- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @peokechukwu the Battousai
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building fun, cool tools that make life easy 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring Gdevelop, javascript etc 
- âš¡ Fun fact:
- I made this game Run Emmy Run! (https://gd.games/peokechukwu/runemmyrun)... enjoy and see if you can beat me on the leaderboard!
- Also, got tired of thinking of meals and how to eat healthy so I cooked this Meal Planner in minutes https://naija-meal-planner.glide.page
